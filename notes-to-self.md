### Ideas for next time...
* Proper design document
	- Chose not to create a proper design doc for this one as I wanted to make sure I stayed motivated by just building off on tutorials as I go...which was a good idea as I was able to throw something together from start to finish, but definitely make one next time.
* Design how you're going to code
	- It was definitely hard/annoying to make certain changes as I go due to how I was not planning ahead at all
* Better concept art?
	- Not sure how to go about this one, start out by searching for some tutorials on how to put together quick sketches of an environment
	- Study colors
	- Study basic lighting
* Time spent on the backgrounds
	- Either learn how to draw faster, or maybe try looking at 3D modeling tools to see if that would help in expediting?

### Actual? Next steps
* Tools/tutorials/topics to take a look at
	- 3D game engine (Unity or Unreal) --> Decided to go with unity
	- Blender (for backgrounds/objects to interact with) --> in-progress
	- How-to game dev type free courses (maybe) --> definitely on the backburner
	- You need to study lighting and colors...and perspective --> in-progress!

### Next steps that might take a while
* Make a saving option
* Music? Or at least some original sound effects
